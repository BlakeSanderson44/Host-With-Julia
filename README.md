# Host With Julia

One-page, mobile-first Next.js + Tailwind site for boutique Airbnb/STR management in Western Washington.

## Development

NPM scripts are placeholders so the project can install and run basic commands in restricted environments.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

The app scaffolding is present, but building requires installing dependencies which may not be available in restricted environments.
